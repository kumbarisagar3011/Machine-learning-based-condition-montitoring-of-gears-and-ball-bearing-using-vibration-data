# Machine-learning-based-condition-montitoring-of-gears-and-ball-bearing-using-vibration-data
This project aims to analyze the vibration data to detect the fault, broken tooth, or any defects in the ball bearing and gears.

# Exploratory Data Anaylsis on vibration data
* THe data is a simulation data  and the vibratio data is collected for a period of time
*The vibration data is collected over a period of time 
* The data is simulated for different kinds of defects like broken tooth gear, fault in gears, healthy gears and misaligned gear
* The ball bearing data is also simulated where there is defect in inner ball and defect in outer ball and outer case**
* The data is processed and checked if there are any null values**
* since data is time dependent, it is time series data where vibration is measured with respect to time**
* Time domain anaylsis is done for feature selection to train a machine learning algorithm**
* Different ML algorithms cross-val score is measured to see the performance and best algorithm is choosen**
